============

Simple analog to digital conversion on Raspberry Pi 2 using High Precision AD/DA Board.

In order to run C program you have to download and build bcm2835 library from http://www.airspayce.com/mikem/bcm2835/.
To run python program you have to get python wrapped bcm2835 library from https://github.com/klobyone/PyBCM2835.

This is a work in progress. End goal here is to create a usable driver for simple usage of High Precision AD/DA Board with Raspberry.
