# TeensyADS1256

Updated 05072018 with changes in Errata video

This is a library for interfacing the ADS1256 with a Teensy 3.1/3.2 microcontroller. 

To use, open the file ads_1256_custom_library using Arduino/Teensyduino

The two additional files contain the constants and functions used in the code.

All 3 files must be located in the same folder (named ads_1256_custom_library)

Demo video available here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjLwvXKz2x8

It is built upon the following existing projects:
https://github.com/adienakhmad/ADS1256
https://github.com/Flydroid/ADS12xx-Library
https://github.com/baettigp/ADS12xx-Library

Please see for more details: https://mattbilsky.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=Teensy_and_the_ADS1256

If someone is interested in helping to turn this into a "conventional" Arduino/Teensy library with constructors, etc. please let me know!
